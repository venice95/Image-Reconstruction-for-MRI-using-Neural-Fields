# Image Reconstruction for MRI using Neural Fields
## Abstract
We introduce a new algorithm that requires zero training images for high-quality magnetic resonance (MR) reconstruction using neural fields (NF). Current state-of-the-art methods for MR reconstruction are based on supervised learning, which requires a large amount of data in image-measurement pairs for training. The data-hungry nature of these learning-based methods significantly hinders their applicability to real-world scenarios. Neural fields, on the other hand, represent a new image-reconstruction paradigm where one optimizes a coordinate-based neural network to fit the collected measurements without any external training data. Based on prior works on neural fields, we proposed a simple algorithm that achieves a similar level of performance as that of an E2E-VarNet, a state-of-the-art learning-based method trained with thousands of images. Our results show the potential of NF-based methods for high-quality MR reconstruction.
